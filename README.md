# CodePath LeetCode Practice Repository
Welcome to my CodePath LeetCode practice repository! This repository showcases my progress and solutions to various LeetCode-like problems as part of the CodePath course.

## About
This repository serves as a record of my journey solving coding problems inspired by LeetCode, completed on Replit. Each problem solution includes a solution and sometimes multiple approaches to solving the problem.

## Why CodePath and Replit?
CodePath provides a structured curriculum that includes practical exercises and projects to help improve coding skills. Replit serves as the platform where I actively practice and commit my solutions, allowing me to showcase my progress on GitHub.
